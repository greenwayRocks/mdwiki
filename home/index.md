### _ Well it seems all great, but what do I do? _

** Note --**  My `diary for the day` is where I start, create tasks and end my day.

  * ** [Today's Diary](#!diary/2022-05-11.md) **
  * ** [Tasks At Hand](#!tasks.md) **
  
----

### _ Projects and Side Projects _

** I started with projects: ** `wiki-push automation` and `project manager script`.

> `Projects` I'm working on:

  * ** [Nmap scanning]() **
  * ** [LateX]() **
  * ** [Project Mgmt]() **

> `Side Projects` I have:

  * ** Complete `pgmr` script **
  * ** Auto-update `Today's Diary` link **
  * ** Integrate `Treesitter, Ultisnips, CoC` in Neovim **
