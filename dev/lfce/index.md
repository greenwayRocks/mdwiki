## _ Linux Foundation Certified Engineer _

- Engineer Level certification
- Wider ranger, great depth of skills
- Focusing on `why & how things work` at a deeper level

### _ Why and how does it work this way ?? _
Find foo out!
Neat.
Wait, do I always have to answer? Well the wiki goes some way of blah and there is a story!
No no no, you're gonna `ripgrep` later for this text, ain't you?
Or more, could you just bind "Ctrl-f" to `fzf` or `rofi` and ripgrep or get just the file opened or whatever.
The story of ripgrep is that it `goes through all text` to check for that word.
So the next time I'll just ripgrep here.
Neat tools and not more of a fun anymore, huh?
Well I don't have to conform anymore.
The means is the ends, and it lets you end ... know how dying is living?
Otherwise I'm not living.
This text is a pain in the ass now, just because my knowledge blahed me!

Well this looks way better `while typing` than `viewing them` as a markdown file.
Let's end this here! @@
Straightening out your thoughts I suppose.
Well I don't know now and ever! ##

Summary: `see things` - how they work and why they work eventually.


### _ I could not get bored. Just a tip. _
I now <F12> my way to typing headers, vim has it going!
Snippets I used, could grab and set up but later into "coco" works. $$ COCONUT OIL stuffs $$
`I say it now` because `the wallpapers fit right that way and `the thing I type on` are heaven and hell.

$ tasks +vim "Here I go, if not now" is always there.

I don't like to use them, they are okay. Your setup, your thing.
===== SKIP THIS ========

### _ No more "going off" to something else _
You're gonna be an `engineer` now, but there is `no reward` or `punishment` anywhere. Feel free.
I'm gonna <F12> now for next title.

### _ Lab Setup - easy peasy if you know it's easy _
Well well, there is a lab setup, yeah "3" actually.
My fedora goes well, not particular to `linux distros` though. We can learn easy.
Lot of "wiki text" though. Not having had written `a script`, I would still jump to writing a simple one ...
yet does the job are `always amazing`. Well that and more in Anthony Nocentino's - Advanced Linux Networking!
Tune up!


### _ Over and out! _
