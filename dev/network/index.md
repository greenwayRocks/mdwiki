My stupid screenkeys were: <C-n>b to go to "~/.bashrc" file in my "home" directory.
Why? I wanted to edit that file. What story has it?

Whose home directory? Your user's. The computer user neccesary for the OS to login. Check out:
```bash
$ whoami # the user logged in now.
```
Where you type it is a "command shell". It spawns great and gives, called **prompt** of the shell.
It's an _interpreter_ to the **fundamental**, uses the language **BASH** that runs all Mac and Linux and now Windows too.
You have actually heard of **Python**, I know. It's just like that, but learn how to apply **scrpting** where ;
in the sense, you can write **your own tools**, aliases - read light, god these terms _you use though_.
It's great to know how these computers work, and make it easy to do things on your own.
I remember I had a Oracle Cloud account (free tier) but needs a **credit card**.
You can spawn **limited OSes** in your cloud but great if I **buy a domain name** online.
I'll do this. And let's not write too much.

Let's make this simple.
I didn't do it cause I scripted "pmgr $project_name" to goto any project or create new one or just pmgr would do the jobs.
My Lord what do you want in Linux says you I guess. 
I guess everything is a file in Linux.

Ricing Done well? Yeah the pmgr is good and the editor's feel too!
Well then move onto this new brand one. Let's talk less from now on, alright?
Done for now.
