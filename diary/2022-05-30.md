### _ A little thing for the diary _

_ ctrl -s is great I learned in 5. Well mine does "no display to what I type" in the shell.
_ ctrl-b to type out "/var/shared/"? Well I'd rather make it:

```bash
cat /dev/urandom
# learn /dev/null
# well everthing in Linux is a file
```

_ "gi" is handy - the G spot by theprimeagean.
_ the "vi; <C-n>/coco<CR> to write coco stuffs. What are they?
_ or wiki; <C-p>coco<CR> to fuzzy find the file.
_ Well i have the option of "one-keystroke", making it float, ...
_ a scratchpad that can be toggled to be hidden - i got three;
_ these things you can do in Windows too. Have "Git Bash" or WSl2 (check this, only this time sure).


Make it do whatever thing you got.
